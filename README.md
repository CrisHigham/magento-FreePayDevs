# magento-FreePayDevs
Magento 2.4.3 module that allows Payment processing for placing an order.

As a developer, to test order processing one needs payment. This module can be dropped into a Magento project, allowing a full payment to be accepted, and the order to be processed.

This is built on the Magento Payment Gateway facade and could be used as a starting point for a Payment Gateway. 

The module needs to be enabled in the config section under Sales -> Payment Methods
